<h1>🧩 TypeCraft — Typing Game in C</h1>

<p><strong>TypeCraft</strong> is a console-based multi-game program written in <strong>C</strong>, designed to improve typing speed, accuracy, and reflexes through fun and challenging mini-games. 
The project features multiple difficulty levels, a scoring and life system, and even a math-based typing challenge — making it both educational and engaging.</p>

<hr>

<h2>🎯 Project Overview</h2>

<p>TypeCraft was developed as a complete C programming project focusing on real-time input handling, file operations, and modular design. 
It offers a diverse range of gameplay modes — from typing single letters and words to forming full sentences and solving math problems under time pressure.</p>

<h2>🕹️ Main Features</h2>

<h3>1. Game Menu</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Interactive menu system allowing players to choose between multiple typing games.</li>
  <li>Option to view instructions loaded from external files.</li>
  <li>Safe exit and restart features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Difficulty Selection</h3>
<p>Players can select <strong>Easy</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, or <strong>Hard</strong> modes. Each level reduces the available time, encouraging faster and more accurate typing.</p>

<h3>3. Accuracy Tracking</h3>
<p>After each session, the game calculates and displays the player’s typing <strong>accuracy percentage</strong>, helping users monitor their progress.</p>

<h3>4. Score & Lives System</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Score</strong> increases with each correct response.</li>
  <li><strong>Lives</strong> decrease for incorrect or timed-out answers.</li>
  <li>The game ends automatically when all lives are lost.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Time Limits</h3>
<p>Different difficulty levels enforce unique time constraints using the <strong>C time library (<code>time.h</code>)</strong> to simulate real-time typing pressure.</p>

<h3>6. Input Validation & Misuse Handling</h3>
<p>If invalid inputs or menu selections are entered, the program detects them and asks the user to restart safely — preventing crashes and misuse.</p>
